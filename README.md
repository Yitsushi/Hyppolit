Hyppolit, the Butler is a bot to connect your services and to does what you want.
He is your personal, team or company butler.

The name comes from a [movie form my country with the same name](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0021985/) from 1931. It's because
I wrote a lot of bots before but now it is not only a bot but an awesome support,
a real butler.
